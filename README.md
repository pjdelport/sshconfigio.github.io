# awesome_sshconfig
A curated list of awesome hacks for [SSH_Config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config); for several years I've improved the use of my ssh_config file, and here I share everything I have obtained so far; I use this on Mac OS X, but should be straighforward to addapt this to Linux.

So far, here is what I have obtained:
* [Awesome SSH_Confing](#awesome_sshconfig)
  * [Separated SSH config files](##ssh_config_groups)
  * [PKI Authentication](#pki_auth) 
- ControMaster / ControlPath
- Tunnels 
- SOCKS Proxy (VPN Browser navigation)
- Jump Hosts (getting straight to some host, behind firewall)
- Remote copy (using pbcopy on remote host)
- Forward Agent (holding your keys to reuse)
- Keep Alive (so your conntection is not dropped)
- Default user defined by context

 (grouping)
 (authentication without passwords, using strong public/private keys)
 (reusing connections)
