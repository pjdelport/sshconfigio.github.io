# [Awesome SSHConfig](https://github.com/mgarces/awesome_sshconfig)
A curated list of awesome hacks for [SSH_Config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config); for several years I've improved the use of my ssh_config file, and here I share everything I have obtained so far; I use this on Mac OS X, but should be straighforward to addapt this to Linux.

So far, here is what I have obtained:
* [Awesome SSH_Confing](https://github.com/mgarces/awesome_sshconfig)
  * [Separated SSH config files](#separated-ssh-config-files)
  * [PKI Authentication](#pki-authentication)
  * [ControMaster / ControlPath](#contromaster--controlpath)
  * [Tunnels](#tunnels) 
  * [SOCKS Proxy](#socks-proxy)
  * [Jump Hosts](#jump-hosts)
  * [Remote copy](#remote-copy)
  * [Forward Agent](#forward-agent)
  * [Keep Alive](#keep-alive)
  * [Default user defined by context](#default_user)

## Separated SSH config files
grouping
## PKI Authentication
authentication without passwords, using strong public/private keys
## ControMaster / ControlPath
reusing connections
## Tunnels
exposing remote and local ports
## SOCKS Proxy
VPN Browser navigation 
## Jump Hosts
getting straight to some host, behind firewall
## Remote copy
using pbcopy on remote host
## Forward Agent
holding your keys to reuse
## Keep Alive
..so your conection is not dropped!
## Default user defined by context
