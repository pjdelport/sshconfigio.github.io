# awesome_sshconfig
My collection of hacks for SSH_Config; for several years I've improved the use of my ssh_config file, and here I share everything I have obtained so far; I use this on Mac OS X, but should be straighforward to addapt this to Linux.

So far, here is what I have obtained:

## Separated SSH config files (grouping)
## PKI Authentication (authentication without passwords, using strong public/private keys)
## ControMaster / ControlPath (reusing connections)
## Tunnels (reverse and forwards tunnels)
## SOCKS Proxy (VPN Browser navigation)
## Jump Hosts (getting straight to some host, behind firewall)
## Remote copy (using pbcopy on remote host)
## Forward Agent (holding your keys to reuse)
## Keep Alive (so your conntection is not dropped)
## Default user defined by context
